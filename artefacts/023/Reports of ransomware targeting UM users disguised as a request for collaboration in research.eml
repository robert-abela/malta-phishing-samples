Ransomware email extract:

I hope this email finds you well. I'm a distinguished professor at Shenzhen University, China. I'm doing a study on internet typology of information flow around the world. The method I'm using is to trace the paths of accessing certain websites. That is, what we obtain is the paths of websites traced from your computer. Consequently, there is no political sensitivity involved in this purely academic project. By integrating the paths of tracing a number of websites around the world, we are able to know how the Internet is connected among countries, and how Internet information flows inside and outside the country as well. This is a fascinating study. I believe the involvement of as many scholars as possible in this study will eventually make it be published in a high impact journal.
