In August 2021 Malta saw a sudden surge in clones news portals and blogs. These appeared to be a perfect copy of the original, with one or two fake atricles added. Most of the links were still the original, pointing to the real site. Looking closely one can find a common theme between all the fake articles but any conclusion based on intution goes beyond the scope of this document, which is about listing all known instances for future reference.

| Original site | Clone | Date |
|---|---|---|

|stradarjali.com|N/A|29/08/2021|

Some of the sites have been turned off after a few days, some of which are redirecting to emanueldelia.com. Eventually all sited were taken down by 30/08/2021.
